### Visualization 1 (Predictions)

* Type of visualization
  -Line graph
* Goal of visualization/what it describes
  -Shows the timeline for UCLA to become an HSI based on current growth rates
* Main authors of the visualization
  -Mansa Krishna
* Libraries/packages/tools used to create the visualization
  -chart.js
* Major difficulties in creating the visualization
  -None
* Additional addons to the visualization (adding animations, changing default settings, etc.)
  -None
* Data files the visualization uses
* Which file the code for the visualization is located in
  -js/posts/student-demographics-hsis/hsis predict

### Visualization 2 (Grad Rates)

* Type of visualization
  -Line chart
* Goal of visualization/what it describes
  -Show the differences between grad rates at UCLA and at UC HSIs
* Main authors of the visualization
  -Samantha Low
* Libraries/packages/tools used to create the visualization
  -chart.js
* Major difficulties in creating the visualization
  -The sizing on the graphs was a nightmare, css uses classes
* Additional addons to the visualization (adding animations, changing default settings, etc.)
  -The vertical line code is from the prof donations article
* Data files the visualization uses
* Which file the code for the visualization is located in
  -js/posts/student-demographics-hsis grad rate grad chart etc.

### Visualization 3 (Grant Money)

* Type of visualization
  Line graph
* Goal of visualization/what it describes
  How much money does each UC campus get from the federal government and total in grants
* Main authors of the visualization
  Lindsey Parungo
* Libraries/packages/tools used to create the visualization
  chart.js
* Major difficulties in creating the visualization
  It was a really tough to get the vertical lines on it
  Ended up using code from prof donations article to create lines
* Additional addons to the visualization (adding animations, changing default settings, etc.)
  Added vertical lines see above
* Data files the visualization uses
  Had trouble with data files so all the data is at the top of the js code(sorry)
* Which file the code for the visualization is located in
  js/posts/DOEViz.js
  js/posts/TotalViz.js
  ## Datasets/Data collection

Describe:

* What data was collected
  -All data was collected from UCOP and a source on graduation rates
* How/from who was it collected (scraper, source, etc.)
  -Downloaded directly from sources
* How long did it take to gather the data
  -Really quick
* Any data formatting done (converting to csv, removing null values, etc.)
  -Had to concatenate files into one long file
* Any data transformation (transforming data to create variables for a visualization)
  -Nope
* Every data file that was created, what data it stored, and how it was formatted

## Sources

### Source A

* Sylvia Herrera, UCLA advisor on HSI goal
  -Contacted by email, relatively easy to contact
