Grant Money:
### All tools used
 
- chart.js
- jupyter notebook
 
### Visualization 1 (Predictions)
 
- Type of visualization
	-Line graph
- Goal of visualization/what it describes
	-Shows the timeline for UCLA to become an HSI based on current growth rates
- Main authors of the visualization
	-Mansa Krishna
- Libraries/packages/tools used to create the visualization
	-chart.js
- Major difficulties in creating the visualization 
	-None
- Additional addons to the visualization (adding animations, changing default settings, etc.)
	-None
- Data files the visualization uses
- Which file the code for the visualization is located in
	-js/posts/student-demographics-hsis/hsis predict 
 
### Visualization 2 (Grad Rates)
 
- Type of visualization
	-Line chart
- Goal of visualization/what it describes
	-Show the differences between grad rates at UCLA and at UC HSIs
- Main authors of the visualization
	-Samantha Low
- Libraries/packages/tools used to create the visualization
	-chart.js
- Major difficulties in creating the visualization 
	-The sizing on the graphs was a nightmare, css uses classes 
- Additional addons to the visualization (adding animations, changing default settings, etc.)
	-The vertical line code is from the prof donations article
- Data files the visualization uses
- Which file the code for the visualization is located in
	-js/posts/student-demographics-hsis grad rate grad chart etc. 
 
### Visualization 3 (Grant Money)
 
- Type of visualization
	Line graph
- Goal of visualization/what it describes
	How much money does each UC campus get from the federal government and total in grants
- Main authors of the visualization
	Lindsey Parungo
- Libraries/packages/tools used to create the visualization
	chart.js
- Major difficulties in creating the visualization 
	It was a really tough to get the vertical lines on it
		Ended up using code from prof donations article to create lines
- Additional addons to the visualization (adding animations, changing default settings, etc.)
	Added vertical lines see above
- Data files the visualization uses
	Had trouble with data files so all the data is at the top of the js code(sorry)
- Which file the code for the visualization is located in
	js/posts/DOEViz.js
	js/posts/TotalViz.js
## Datasets/Data collection
 
Describe:
 
- What data was collected
	-All data was collected from UCOP and a source on graduation rates
- How/from who was it collected (scraper, source, etc.)
	-Downloaded directly from sources
- How long did it take to gather the data
	-Really quick
- Any data formatting done (converting to csv, removing null values, etc.)
	-Had to concatenate files into one long file
- Any data transformation (transforming data to create variables for a visualization)
	-Nope
- Every data file that was created, what data it stored, and how it was formatted
