      Welcome to The Stack! 
      <br> <br>
      This is a compilation of all frequently used tools and skills during the development of Stack projects.
      This guide is intended to be a resource for first-time learning as well as a reference guide for common 
      commands and tools until they become muscle memory (they are you're programming training wheels). 
      This can be a lot of information to digest at once, especially if this is all new to you, 
      so don't be afraid if you forget things, just open this guide back up. It also references other guides I found
      online that explain the topic better really well, so it is highly recommended to go through those. 
      <br> <br>
      The guide is broken down into sections so you can skip to the topics relevant to you, 
      but if it's your first time developing with The Stack, it's recommended that you go through 
      them in order. Having said that, this guide is designed to be as beginner friendly as possible, 
      so if you're comfortable with certain topics, feel free to skip over them. There are some more 
      advanced sections for topics you can dive into once you feel comfortable with the basics.  
      <br> <br>
      P.S. Regardless of your previous experience, I recommend going through the 
      <a href="/docs/good-code-practices/">good coding practices section</a> and the <a href="#">good data visualization practices section</a>.
