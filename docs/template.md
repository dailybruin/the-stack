## A Guide to Guide

# Topic
Introduce your topic

# Summary
Summarize your tutorial, ideally breaking it down into sections linked here, so people can skip over stuff they already know

# Practice
It's always helpful to add some simple practice, because programming is all about #learning-by-doing
(TODO: add links for JSFiddle, or other fiddling software)

# Resources
Include links to other resources and guides to allow further exploration, or to cite your sources. 
It's also great to include reference cheat sheets if your topic warrants it.

# Template
Copy this to create your own guide.
