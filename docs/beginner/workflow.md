## Workflow

# Pitch and ideas development meeting

The Stack holds a weekly pitch and ideas development meeting where any
interested parties – developers, journalists, etc. can come to pitch new ideas
and/or develop existing ideas. Development of existing ideas involves
discussing angles for stories, technical implementation, and
design/presentation of posts.

# Story assignment

When possible, stories are assigned at the pitch/ideas meeting. If people
are not present or not immediately contactable, stories may be assigned later.
When a story is assigned, a time is chosen for an initial meeting with all
interested parties.

# Initial meeting (angle, approach)

The initial meeting is to get everyone on the same page with the scope, goal,
and implementation of the project. Deadlines for specific components and
mockups happen here. This is also where the git story branch is created.
If the contributor is a new contributor, they are set up with a local
copy of the site for development. A follow-up meeting is scheduled.

# Follow-up meetings (development)

Follow-up meetings happen as necessary to check progress on development, work
through any issues, and discuss any changes in scope/angle. These meetings
should happen no less frequently than once a week until completion of the
project.

# Code review and findings meeting (development, writing)

When the developer has finished the technical part of the post, the data
editor will do a code review and discuss any changes to be made at this
meeting. At this point, the developer or whoever is doing the writing will
also discuss the text content of the post with the data editor. A deadline is
set for writing.

# Writing

The developer or other individual writes the post.

# Editing

The data editor edits the post. He or she adds post metadata including
headline, teaser, featured image, open graph image, and key takeaways.

# Edits meeting (address edits, retro)

The data editor and writer discuss edits, and the writer addresses any changes
at this meeting. A project retro is also performed here where interested
parties discuss what went well and what could be improved in communication,
workflow, development, writing, etc. If any of the contributors to the post
are new contributors, they create an author profile here.

# Copy edits

The data editor sends the post to Copy. Copy makes edits on the story branch
and commits changes.

# Merge to master

The data editor merges the story branch to master and resolves any merge
conflicts.

# Verification

The data editor verifies that the merge hasn't broken anything and that
everything in the post works as expected.

# Deployment

The data editor merges master to the production branch, gh-pages, and pushes
to remote to deploy.

# Social media

The data editor schedules or sends social media.
