## Intro to Markdown

Every page in The Stack uses Markdown. Markdown is a light-weight formatting tool for all your articles.

In simple terms, markdown is like a glorified Google Doc, which lets you 
- add code (HTML) in your file
- use standard syntax to create headings, add links and images. 

Writing a hashtag before your heading (for example, "# HEADING") creates a heading. And the more hashtags (upto 7) you add in front of it, the smaller the heading gets. For example, ("### SMALLER HEADING" creates a smaller heading). 

# HEADING
This is an example of a heading that uses a single hashtag.

### SMALLER HEADING
This is an example of a heading that uses 3 hashtags.

There are also ways to add links, images, lists, tables, etc.
Whenever you need to figure out how to do something, look it up from this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet).

### Internal Links
One of the things the cheatsheet doesn't explain is how to create internal links, i.e., how to create links to different parts of the page (like how clicking [here](#intro-to-markdown) can take you to the top of the page).

Every title in Markdown can be used as a link. So, for example, "# HEADING" above is a link and you can refer to it by:

`[go to heading](#heading)`

Click this link to go to 'HEADING': [go to heading](#heading)

The syntax to refer to the links is
- make everything lowercase
- add a '-' for spaces

So, for example:

`[go to smaller heading](#smaller-heading)`

Click this link to go to 'SMALLER HEADING': [go to smaller heading](#smaller-heading)
