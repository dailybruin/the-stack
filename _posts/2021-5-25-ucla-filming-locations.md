UCLA’s campus has cemented itself as a hotspot for Hollywood filming over the years. Throughout the school year, students will often see cameras and film crews as they walk to class. On campus tours, Kerckhoff Hall is singled out as the backdrop of the iconic film “Legally Blonde.” Like the scene depicted in “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” many students can relate to the hectic experience of walking down a crowded Bruinwalk while being handed flyers. In this article, we analyze trends regarding filmography at UCLA using the list on IMDbB in which UCLA is tagged as a filming location. 

### The Ideal Filming Location
To film at UCLA, crews must contact the UCLA Events Office and follow a list of guidelines. The cost of filming is a combination of the UCLA film permit fee, event manager staffing costs, location venue rental fees, parking, police and any other facilities or other miscellaneous services. For a full day, between six to 12 hours, the permit fee for movie and television filming by itself is $4,510. 

While most of campus is available for filming, some areas are not allowed to be captured by commercial shooting. These locations include: the full South façade of Royce Hall with roofline and towers, full North façade of Powell Library with roofline, full North façade of Kerckhoff Hall with roofline & spires, Bruin Bear, Health Sciences/Medical Center buildings, Murphy Hall, Chancellor’s Residence, residential halls, dining halls and other housing facilities. 

However, dDespite the fees and restrictions, UCLA is still a popular filming location great place to film for two primary reasons,. The first reason is because of its location and its architecture. 

“UCLA has the added advantage of the fact that it's in Los Angeles, which means it's right next door to Hollywood and so it's quite convenient for Southern California film crews to work at UCLA,” said Jonathan Kuntz, a professor at the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television. 

The city's reputation for sunny days yearlong is an added bonus. It's just practical to be filming here instead of places on the East Coast where I'm sure it's a lot less temperate and a lot more volatile, said Ashley Davis, a fourth-year English and African American studies student with a film minor. 

The Los Angeles sunshine is particularly helpful for filmmakers who like to use old-school methods. David Figueroa, a fourth-year psychology student with a film minor, has completed a majority of his shorts on Super 8mm film. 

“One of the rules (of working with film) is that it's always better to overexpose. When it comes to digital, I think it's much easier to fix (exposure) on the spot … whereas with film, it's kind of like a shot in the dark ... Nothing hurts more than getting back a roll of film and it's underexposed,” said Figueroa. 

Additionally, Secondly, UCLA stands out because of its quintessential college look. UCLA is grand and it's gigantic, so it'll appear in the background quite distinctively, said Kuntz. 

“You've got these grand old buildings that call up quickly, the associations in our head of university. You know, big, major university. That's its greatest strength,” said Kuntz. “UCLA also has some good interiors. We've got some classic big classrooms that can be used as well.”

Dickinson Court, which includes Royce Hall and Powell Library, has beenwas the most common filming location on campus. Oof the 50 works filmed at UCLA with the highest ratings on IMDb, most popular UCLA films. There were x included scenes at Dickson Court. instances of filmography there. 

“UCLA’s got certain parts of it that are very, you might say, old school. Obviously Royce Hall, and I'd also say Powell Library. You can't look much more like a university than those buildings,” said Kuntz. “UCLA grabs you right away perfectly in the middle of campus there.”

As a result of UCLA’s classic brickcollege buildings, it has portrayedplayed numerous different universitiescolleges on-screen, both real and fictional. Notably, because Harvard University generally doesn’t allow commercial filming on its campus, UCLA has served as the Ivy League university in filmography such as “Legally Blonde” and “The Social Network.” More recently, UCLA was filmed as the fictional Winchester University in the TV series “Dear White People.”

“It gives me some satisfaction. Knowing that we're the stunt double of one of the top schools and are considered like that in the world makes me feel a little smug,” said Davis.

Although much of the filmography on the map is clustered around Royce Hall and Powell Library, other UCLA buildings have made appearances on the big screen as well. The filming of “The Social Network” memory atof Melnitz Hall, which houses the Film, Television and Digital Media department, in “The Social Network”  particularly stands out to Kuntz, who has taught at UCLA for 35 years. 

“They actually brought in snow and recreated a cold Northeast kind of winter there on the sunny UCLA campus, so they could shoot several shots there instead of at Harvard … I guess that's my favorite just because it's so different. When I teach, I'm in that building every single day,” said Kuntz. 

For those looking to film outside the hustle and bustle of Royce Hall and Powell Library, the Sculpture Garden and Botanical Garden come to mind for Figueroa. 

“I want to film something in the Sculpture Garden. The Botanical Garden is also really beautiful. And there aren't that many people there. If you think about it, there are people walking to Royce and Powell, so if you want to make something where there aren't people in the shot, it's really easy to achieve that at those two places,” said Figureoa.

### Breaking Down the Most Popular Genres 
<div id = 'GenreChart' style='height: 100vh'></div>

Drama, short film and comedy are the most popular genres of filmography at UCLA. This is not particularly surprising given the backdrop that the campus provides. A film shot at UCLA probably involves college students, so it's going to be something related to college students and comedies and romances make more sense than action or adventure films, said Kuntz.

Over the course of the last two decades, there has been an increasing number of short films. Of the 89 total short films in the dataset, 78 of them were filmed in the last two decades. Prior to 2003, there were only 11 short films since 1947, which means that the number of short films has increased more than 700%.

This sharp increase parallels the growing accessibility of smartphone cameras, editing software, and video-sharing social media platforms. 

Shorts are cheap. They don't take that much time. They can be between five to 30 minutes. There's a lot of free editing software now to put everything that you made together. You don't need that many people to make them. You just need one person with the camera, and then whatever subjects you're filming in front of it. There's that chance of anyone being able to pursue their passion and share with other people through social media, said Figueroa.

For students, this accessibility is particularly valuable. Figueroa often shoots on a Super 8mm camera. He estimates that one cartridge of film is $40, which at a rate of 18 frames per second, equates to about three and a half minutes of footage. To have a cartridge developed, he estimates that it's another $100 per roll.

“For a lot of broke college students like myself, that's not the best thing, because that's just going to break the bank. So with the phone in your pocket, you don't have to pay for that stuff. With students who just want to make something and put it out to increase (their) portfolio, that's just a super beneficial way. It doesn't cost money, and it's very accessible,” said Figueroa.

### History of Filmography at UCLA 
<div id= 'chartdiv' style='height: 100vh'></div>

The first instance of filmography at UCLA in our data dates back to the 1932 film “Shopworn.” However, before UCLA was even built, a silent film “The Big Parade” was filmed on the campus location. The final sequences of the film, which take place in the fields of France, were shot in Westwood on what would soon become the UCLA campus.

In the years since “The Big Parade,” Hollywood and Westwood have changed drastically, but one thing has remained constant., Westwood has continued to attract film crews and cameras., and fFor UCLA students, seeing film crews on campus has made for  it makes for some unforgettable memories. 

“I remember Quentin Tarantino was filming his last movie in Westwood, and I walked down to see the production. I saw Margot Robbie from like a mile away and I was like, this is insane. I will never get any more closer to moviemaking than I am currently right now. It's literally the heart of it all …  It's just a surreal experience,” said Figueroa.
