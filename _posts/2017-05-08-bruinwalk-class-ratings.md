A UCLA education is a huge investment â€“ each resident undergraduate student pays up to **$1,230** per class in tuition and fees,<sup><a href="#cite-1">[1]</a></sup> and invests about **100 hours** per class.<sup><a href="#cite-2">[2]</a></sup> 

Our analysis of Bruinwalk ratings, sourced from thousands of students, can help you make that investment worthwhile. Thereâ€™s more to a professor than their Bruinwalk rating, just like thereâ€™s more to a student than their GPA, but students can use ratings and reviews to select courses that are worth their time and money.

## The data

The data visualized below is sourced from **41,515 ratings** on [bruinwalk.com]((http://bruinwalk.com)) as of February 2017. Students rate each course and professor pairing on five criteria: overall rating, class easiness, workload, professor helpfulness and professor clarity.

Only course and professor pairings with **15 or more** ratings were included when analyzing their *average* ratings. These comprise the **577 most-reviewed courses** on Bruinwalk, with a combined total of 14,534 ratings.

  <p>The most common overall rating students award is a <strong>4</strong>, which accounts for <strong>33.8 percent</strong> of all ratings. This skews the distribution toward the higher end, away from the expected average of 2.5. </p>

  <h2>Easiness rating</h2>

  <p>Donâ€™t take one of these classes unless youâ€™re prepared to put in a lot of work.</p>
  <h3>The 25 hardest classes</h3>
  <ratings-list :ratings="hardest" rating-type="easiness_rating" 
                id="hardest"></ratings-list>

  <p>Students have rated more courses as difficult than easy. Of the courses with 15 or more ratings, eleven have a 1.00 average, the most difficult rating. Only six of these courses have ratings above 4.00.</p>
  
  <p>The most common rating students award is a <strong>2</strong>, which accounts for <strong>39.2 percent</strong> of all easiness ratings.</p>

  <h2>Correlating rating criteria</h2>

  <p>This wonâ€™t come as a surprise: <strong>Students tend to rate easier classes more favorably overall</strong>. No courses rated easy (easiness rating above 3.50) were rated poorly overall (overall rating below 2.50).</p>
  
  <p>But students have also given high overall ratings to a substantial number of difficult courses. Difficult courses with high overall ratings occupy the upper left corner of the following scatter plot.</p>

  <h3>Students rarely award a low overall rating to an easy course, but they also rate many difficult courses favorably.</h3>

  <p>Students seem to prefer clear professors over easy courses. Courses with higher professor clarity ratings, or those with <strong>professors who are easier to understand</strong>, are more highly rated overall than courses with low clarity ratings. The clarity rating is the best predictor for studentsâ€™ overall course satisfaction â€“ its line of best fit has an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.797.</p>
  
  <p>Professor clarity only narrowly beats out <strong>professor helpfulness</strong> in predicting a studentâ€™s overall course rating (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.703), but it signifcantly beats out both class easiness (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.185) and workload (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.182) ratings.</p>

  <h3>A professorâ€™s clarity rating is the best predictor of a classâ€™s overall rating.</h3>

## In conclusion

Choosing the right courses and professors can make your investment in a UCLA education much more worthwhile. Each class comes with a high price, so itâ€™s important to go out of your way to find good classes â€“Â and good professors â€“Â whenever possible.
