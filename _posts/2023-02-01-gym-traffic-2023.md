Let's compare the traffic between the two facilities.

A few interesting insights:

* Traffic dips between noon and around 1:30 PM on weekdays.
* Traffic rapidly climbs from 2 PM onward until it reaches the peak at around 5:30 PM on weekdays.
* BFit is busier than Wooden on weekends, especially on evenings. Weekend traffic at Wooden doesn't appear to fluctuate that much throughout the day.
* Less people exercise towards the end of a quarter.

## More on BFit

The opening of BFit has given students who live on the hill or even in the apartments more options. But are Bruins really using BFit? Has BFit improve student’s overall health? **Daily Bruin Radio** reporter Sarika Bharil investigated the effects that BFit has had on student fitness. Listen to the episode.

## Data and Model

UCLA Recreation officials graciously provided the dataset, which consisted around 1.5 million records in total, spanning from June 2015 to June 2016, and containing the *time stamp*, *type of user* (ie. undergrad, grad or staff), and *facility name* (ie. Wooden, BFit, KREC, or Sunset Rec) of each entrance.

Since the dataset doesn't have exit time stamps, **we have to guess how long each workout lasted** – we need to find a distribution and good enough parameters using *survey data*. Sixty-five UCLA students responded to an online survey asking them how long they spent at the gym the last time they went. The *Weibull distribution* was chosen because of its suitability for modeling timed events, and parameters were then inferred from the survey data.

Once we have a distribution model, we assume each visitor in the records did the following:

1. Entered at actual time, *provided by UCLA Recreation's raw data*
2. Remained for X number of time intervals, *simulated from the model*
3. Exited

Now we simply sum all the people who remained at each time point and do the necessary math to get the estimated average traffic for different times at each facility.

How reliable is the model? Estimates of the exact headcount varied considerably depending on model selection. But the **relative difference** between the different times of day, days of week, or weeks of quarter are very consistent so the trends shown in relative scales are reliable regardless of which model we pick.
