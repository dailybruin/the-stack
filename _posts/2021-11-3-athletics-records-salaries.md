### Introduction
In each of the 5 years from 2015 to 2019 a head coach for men’s basketball or football was the highest paid employee at UCLA. In 2020, the two highest paid employees from any UC school were Chip Kelly, head coach of the UCLA football team and Mick Cronin, head coach of the UCLA men’s basketball team. Kelly’s gross salary of $4.3 million was the only salary over $4 million within the UC system. To add perspective, Kelly’s salary was almost 9 times the size of Gene Block’s, the UCLA Chancellor, salary of $484,947. However, not all coaches receive the same level of monetary compensation. 

The Stack analyzed salaries for head coaches of all UCLA’s sports from 2015 to 2019 and did a comparison between the salaries of head football coaches across the PAC-12.

### Why are salaries for football and basketball consistently higher than other sports?
College athletics departments generally make money from a combination of sources including, media rights and ticket sales. Because of their larger fan base, football and basketball are generally the largest revenue generating sports. Because of the money drawn in through revenue generating sports, coaches of those sports tend to have the highest salaries Colin Flitoft, a former UCLA Football punter, said

“At the end of the day, salaries for revenue-generating sports are disproportionately high because that’s what the fans want to see, that’s where the TV money is, and the sponsorship revenue,” Flintoft said.

In 2019 football and men’s basketball accounted for 84.4% of UCLA’s team driven revenue. These revenue generating sports are what allows other sports to operate. 

 “It’s the big money making sports that are the reasons why smaller sports can keep the lights on, pay coaches and give scholarships” Flintoft said. 

In an Associated Press survey of Division 1 Athletic Directors in 2021, 75% said that sharing revenues with athletes would make it more difficult to comply with Title IX by providing equal athletic opportunities for men and women. The reduction in revenue to the school would not allow them to operate as many athletic programs resulting in inequality of opportunity. 
The differences in revenue may account for the discrepancy between the salaries for men’s and women’s basketball, with Cronin at $4.2M per year and head women’s basketball coach Cori Close making $600k per year. However, the wage gap between the coaches for men’s and women’s sports exists in non-revenue generating sports as well. The only sport in which the women’s coach made more than the men’s coach was women’s coach over the last 5 years was volleyball. 

### Can UCLA avoid massive contract buyouts in the future?

In the 5 years from 2015-2019, the third and fourth highest average salaries were paid to coaches that no longer work for UCLA as part of a contract buyout for former men’s basketball and football coaches. The buyouts written into contracts are worth millions of dollars, such as Steve Alford’s $3.6M for men’s basketball and Jim Mora’s $12M buyout for football.

Despite the risk of large payouts, buyouts are an important part of athletics contracts because coaches want job security, so that they will not be fired after a tough season or because they lose the favor of the fans, Flintoft said.

“Avoiding buyouts is tough because if you want to attract a good coach, you have to include a buyout in there in case things do go awry,” Flintoft said. 

### Head football coach salaries in the PAC-12
UCLA is not the only university budgeting large sums of money towards athletic departments and coaching salaries. Within the PAC-12, the annual Head Football coach salary from 2015-2020 averaged at almost $3 million and all schools have exceeded an annual salary over 1.5 million dollars in the same period.

The graph above shows the base scheduled pay for the head football coaching position based on the contract each coach signed at the beginning of his first season. However, this number does not include the additional monetary bonuses coaches can receive from broadcasting revenue, team records, accomplishments and appearances. 

For example, Mel Tucker, single-season head football coach of the Colorado Buffs signed a 5 year contract with a starting salary of $2.4 million in 2019 with annual increases of $275,000 through Dec. 31, 2023. Within his contract, Tucker was also promised additional incentives such as $50,000 if the team recorded six wins in the 2019 season, $750,000 if the buffs win the national championship, 50 thousand dollars if the team attains a 75% graduation success along with many more incentives. These were the terms agreed in the 5-year contract Tucker signed before the 2019 season, but there is no available data on the total pay Tucker received in addition to his base salary of 2.4 million. 

### Conclusion
Coaches are measured by a range of statistics including records, graduation rates, and playoff performance, but some aspects of coaching cannot be measured with a statistic. Musser said coaches are there to help athletes succeed, even outside of the sport.

 “A coach is there to guide you and to teach you and to help you succeed, not just on the court or on the playing field, or in the gym, but to help you go where you want to whether it's Pro or whether it's to make a greater influence, as you proceed on with life.” Musser said.  

Ultimately, the valuing coaches is part of the Athletic Director’s job and can help decide what level of compensation is fair based on market value and other statistics, as part of contract negotiations to put their school and athletic program in the best position to succeed. 

In light of UCLA Football’s 8-4 finish and qualification for a bowl game last season, Flintoft said Kelly’s 4.7M per year contract may be on the higher end, but still was within normal compared to who UCLA competes with. 

“I wouldn’t say it’s overpriced or underpriced…your value is what people give you.” Flintoft said.
