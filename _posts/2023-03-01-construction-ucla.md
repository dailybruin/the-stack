For the past few years, construction projects have become an undeniable part of daily life for all students on UCLA's bustling campus. In order to properly understand the scope of these projects, The Stack has collected data from the UC Office of the President’s capital planning information. Between the 53 completed and 4 active construction projects since 2013, UCLA has pledged $2,518,186,000 to campus development and renovation projects (CQ #1). The average cost of these projects is $4,4178,702, with the Ostin AV Equipment Installation costing $1,044,000 at the lowest end and the Southwest Campus Apartments, which are still being built, costing $383,290,000 at the highest end (CQ #1). By contextualizing these projects, The Stack has identified trends in spending, changes in budget, and construction delays that directly affect the campus environment.

Spending by Year & Cost vs Number of Projects (Angel)
Including active projects, 2022 saw the most construction spending and 2018 saw the least. According to the data provided, only one project was completed in 2018, the CHS Seismic Correction and Fire Safety, which cost $52,155,000 (CQ #1). In 2017, 26 projects were completed, which is the greatest number for any year between 2013 and 2022 (CQ #1). Higher spending in 2022 than 2017 despite far fewer projects, with only 7 completed and active projects in 2022, can be attributed to far higher per project costs in 2022 (CQ #1). Particularly, the average cost of a project in 2022 is $129,053,857, while the 2017 average is $15,851,154 (CQ #1).

Changes in Spending (Angel & Maddy)
While the number and type of projects play a role in dictating costs as is shown by the varying proportions of projects and costs per year, other factors often cause changes in the cost of construction by producing unforeseen costs or opportunities to save. Although many projects are able to maintain their initial budget, significant changes are apparent in the data, particularly the Northwest Campus Student Housing Infill, which cost 40% less than initially intended, and the Clark Library Seismic Correction, which cost an additional almost 25% (CQ #1). Before 2022, the primary causes for these changes included favorable and unfavorable bids from contractors and site conditions (CQ #1). However, delays in active projects that may result in future price augmentation are attributed to COVID, which reflects changes in the factors that influence construction.

About the Data (Angel)
The data was collected from the UC Office of the President’s capital annual status reports. The information related to UCLA was isolated from the other UC campuses and organized as “new construction” or “renovation.” Particularly, the figures that appear are the funds dedicated to construction projects categorized by the year they were completed and, in the case of active projects, the year they are listed on the annual status report (2022). These documents described the construction projects in terms of their name, type, original budget, augmented budget, percentage change in price, notes, year, and phase of construction. Before 2017, the data also includes whether projects are state or non-state funded, but funding information is available in a more detailed form in the capital financial plans, which offer 6-year projections of construction across the UC campuses.
