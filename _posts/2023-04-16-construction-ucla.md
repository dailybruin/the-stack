key_takeaways:
    - For completed and active projects from 2013 to 2022 UCLA budgeted over 2.5 trillion dollars for new construction and renovations. 
    - Projects completed in 2022 including the new dorm buildings Olympic and Centennial and the new University Apartment building Gayley heights cost over 443 million dollars.
    - New projects accounted for just under 75% of spending for projects completed between 2013 and 2022 while renovations accounted for the other 25%.

### Introduction

Over the past few years, construction projects have become an unavoidable part of daily life for students on UCLA's bustling campus.

In order to comprehensively understand the scope of these projects, The Stack has collected data from the UC Office of the President’s capital planning information. Between the 53 completed and 4 active construction projects since 2013, UCLA has pledged $2,518,186,000 to campus development and renovation projects (CQ #1). The average cost of these projects is $4,4178,702. The least costly project was the Ostin AV Equipment Installation at $1,044,000, and the most costly project is the Southwest Campus Apartments, costing $383,290,000 (CQ #1). The Stack has identified trends in spending, changes in budget, and construction delays that directly affect the campus environment. Of the total 1.95 trillion dollars spent on projects that were completed between 2013 and 2022, 490 million dollars went towards renovations while the remaining 1.46 trillion went towards new construction.

Peter Hendrickson, Associate Vice Chancellor for Design and Construction, said that construction projects require immense planning and analysis. “A major part of the campus project development process involves evaluating the capital needs of a school, department, or business unit, and aligning them with capital resources available to the campus,” Hendrickson said. “For specific projects, project initiation and planning activities involve studying environmental and site alternatives and developing conceptual program, funding, and schedule parameters.”

### Spending by Year & Cost vs Number of Projects

Including active projects, 2022 saw the most construction spending while 2018 saw the least. According to the data provided, only one project was completed in 2018, the CHS Seismic Correction and Fire Safety, which cost $52,155,000 (CQ #1). In 2017, 26 projects were completed, which is the greatest number for any year between 2013 and 2022 (CQ #1). Higher spending in 2022 than 2017 despite far fewer projects, with only 7 completed and active projects in 2022, can be attributed to far higher per project costs in 2022 (CQ #1). Particularly, the average cost of a project in 2022 was $129,053,857, while the 2017 average was $15,851,154 (CQ #1).

### Changes in Spending

While the number and type of projects play a role in dictating costs as is shown by the varying proportions of projects and costs per year, other factors often cause changes in the cost of construction by producing unforeseen costs or opportunities to save. Although many projects are able to maintain their initial budget, some projects see significant changes, particularly the Northwest Campus Student Housing Infill, which cost 40% less than initially intended, and the Clark Library Seismic Correction, which cost an additional almost 25% (CQ #1). Before 2022, the primary causes for these changes included favorable and unfavorable offers from contractors and site conditions (CQ #1). However, delays in more recent projects are attributed to COVID, which reflects changes in the factors that influence construction.

The graph above displays projects that were completed between 2013 and 2022. We can compare the original budget set compared to the final amount spent on a project. Typically, construction projects come in at or below budget. We see a dip in completed project spending that began in 2018 and continued through the COVID-19 pandemic. We also see a huge spike in completed projects between 2021 and 2022 with over a 435% year over year increase in spending. This is due to the new University Apartment buildings as well as Olympic and Centennial dorm buildings which were completed in 2022. The new Olympic and Centennial dorm buildings accounted for $223,042,000 or just over 50% of 2022 spending (CQ #5 and #6). The total spending for new University apartment building Gayley Heights was $184,500,000 or about 41% of 2022 spending (CQ #5 and CQ #7).

### Conclusion

While construction can be frustrating for many students, the new university apartments and dorms allow UCLA to guarantee housing for all students (CQ #3).

Alexa Escamilla, a second-year Molecular Cellular Developmental Biology student, currently lives in Laurel, one of the new Undergraduate Apartment buildings (CQ #4 0:08 & 0:38 & 1:02). She chose a 4 bed 2 bath in Laurel, which houses 8 occupants, because it was a cheaper option than other buildings (CQ #4 2:26).

So far Escamilla enjoys the modern look of her apartment as well as the view of the sunset (CQ #4 9:15). However, she wishes the building had a gym (CQ #4 5:28). Laurel is also further than many other University Apartments, but Escamilla says the bus stop just outside her building makes getting to campus easy (CQ #4 5:28).

Part of the allure of Laurel to Escamilla was that it was a new development. “I like that I’m the first person living there,” Escamilla said (CQ #4 9:03).

On the other hand, some students are irked by the recent construction, particularly because they will not have the opportunity to reap the benefits of the renovations. Doryenna Ammari, a third-year Political Science major, said that the constant construction is highly disruptive. “It’s been really difficult to navigate campus, even when I’m just getting to my classes.” (CQ #8).

She expressed further disappointment with the closure of iconic campus destinations, such as Powell Library’s Main Reading Room, which is undergoing seismic renovations. “Especially as a student during COVID, I didn’t have my first year of college here, and not being able to take graduation photos at Powell is just really disappointing.” (CQ #8).

### About the Data

The data was collected from the UC Office of the President’s capital annual status reports. The information related to UCLA was isolated from the other UC campuses and organized as “new construction” or “renovation.” Particularly, the figures that appear are the funds dedicated to construction projects categorized by the year they were completed and, in the case of active projects, the year they are listed on the annual status report (2022). These documents described the construction projects in terms of their name, type, original budget, augmented budget, percentage change in price, notes, year, and phase of construction. Before 2017, the data also includes whether projects are state or non-state funded, but funding information is available in a more detailed form in the capital financial plans, which offer 6-year projections of construction across the UC campuses. (CQ #2)
