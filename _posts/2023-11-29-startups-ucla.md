  - According to the election code found on the 2023 elections board [website](https://www.uclaelectionsboard.org/docs-forms), candidates are allowed to spend up to $500 on their campaigns, yet the average campaign spending over the last four years was $118.
  - Over the last eight years, five elections have met the 20% voter turnout threshold required to pass a referendum.
