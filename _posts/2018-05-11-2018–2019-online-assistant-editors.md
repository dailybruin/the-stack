As the Daily Bruin ventures into #online-first territory, I'm very happy to announce Online will be doing some ~restructuring~ and have not one, not two, but five assistant editors! Look forward to five times the fun!

## Stack Editor – Henna Dialani

Henna joined the Stack this year with lots of amazing ideas and has continued to impress with both her dedication to The Bruin and her knowledge about data visualization and journalistic sensibilities. Plus look at her cute baby picture! If that doesn't scream baby Edward Tufte I don't know what does.

When asked what love is, Henna responded with the following:

```js
let love = data + narratives;
```


## Bruinwalk Director – Grace Yu

Grace has been with the Bruinwalk team since her freshman year and was responsible for features this year such as the adblock-blocker. In addition to being able to rock a bee costume, she has a lot of great ideas for Bruinwalk next year and I'm super excited to see what she does.

When asked what love is, Grace wrote:

```js
let happiness = puppies || sunrises || !(olives_on_pizza);
let love =​friends + fud + happiness;
```

## Internal Tools Director – Dustin Newman

Dustin's favorite movie appears to be Scooby Doo, which when combined with his passion and ideas for improving all of the various tools The Bruin has come to rely on, made him the most qualified applicant for the job. I'm beyond excited for the farm he will create for all of us.

When asked what love is, Dustin told us:

```js
let love = (person1, person2) => {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    if (
      truth &&
      honesty &&
      person1.caresFor(person2) &&
      person2.caresFor(person1)
    ) {
      let affirmation = person1.name + " loves " + person2.name;
      resolve(affirmation);
    } else {
      let err = new Error("Incompatible Types");
      reject(err);
    }
  });
};
love(person1, person2).then(
  function(success) {
    console.log(success);
  },
  function(err) {
    tryAgain();
  }
);
// assume (var truth = true; var honesty = true;), tryAgain() is defined, and person1 and person2 exist and have name and caresFor() properties

```

## External Sites Director – Ashley Miao

Perhaps knowing that she would one day work for an organization in which a strong culture of finding and using baby pictures to make formal announcements exists, young Ashley blocked the camera well in this picture – just not well enough!

Ashley joined the Daily Bruin this past fall on the Bruinwalk team and since then has impressed everyone with not only her technical know-how but design expertise. I'm beyond excited for Ashley to work closely all of ya'll to make some #online-first ~~flatpages~~ interactives.

When asked what love is, Ashley coded:

```js
let love = “cashew butter”;
```

## Main Site Director – Mike Zhang

<img src="/img/posts/assistant-editors/mike.jpg" alt="Baby Mike!">

You know already know and love him so I don't really feel like I need to introduce him. Back for his victory lap, Mike Zhang will be taking on the new role of Main Site director and leading a full redesign of dailybruin.com. Given his experience/overqualification with both Design and Online, there's no doubt in my mind that he will do an amazing job.

When asked what love is, Mike responded with the answer of:

```js
let love = dbOrgNames.filter(name => name.hasDash());
```

And those your Daily-Bruin Online assistant editors for 2018–2019! Woooooooo!!!!!!
