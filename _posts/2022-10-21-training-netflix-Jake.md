My favorite TV show is ‘I Think You Should Leave’. Tim Robinson, who appeared on SNL in 2012, displays his creative and wacky sketch comedy routines in digestible 15-minute episodes. Guest stars include big names in the comedy industry including Andy Samberg, Fred Willard, and Kate Berlant. For fans anticipating a new season (including myself), ‘I Think You Should Leave’ has been renewed for a third season on Netflix.
