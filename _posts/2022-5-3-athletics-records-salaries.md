### Introduction
From 2015 to 2019, a head coach for men’s basketball or football was the highest paid employee at UCLA (CQ 3). In 2020, the two highest paid employees from any UC school were Chip Kelly, head coach of the UCLA football team and Mick Cronin, head coach of the UCLA men’s basketball team. Kelly’s gross salary of $4.3 million was the only salary over $4 million within the UC system. To add perspective, Kelly’s salary was almost 9 times the size of Gene Block’s, the UCLA Chancellor, salary of $484,947. However, not all coaches receive the same level of monetary compensation. 

The Stack analyzed salaries for head coaches of all UCLA Division I sports from 2015 to 2019 and compared the salaries of head football coaches across the PAC-12.

### Why are salaries for football and basketball consistently higher than other sports?
College athletics departments make money from a combination of sources including media rights, sponsorships and ticket sales(CQ 4). Because of their larger fan base, football and basketball are generally the largest revenue-generating sports(CQ 5). 

Colin Flintoft, a former UCLA football punter(CQ 6), said that because of the money drawn in through revenue generating sports, coaches of those sports tend to have the highest salaries(CQ 7).

In 2019 football and men’s basketball accounted for 84.4% of UCLA’s revenue brought in by athletic teams (CQ 8). 

 “It’s the big money making sports that are the reasons why smaller sports can keep the lights on, pay coaches and give scholarships” Flintoft said. 

Both revenue generating sports are men’s sports. Tessa Musser, UCLA Women’s Club Basketball Player(CQ 9), said the differences in crowds for men’s and women’s basketball games can be sensed just by attending games. She also added that you could feel a difference in promotion for men’s games as compared to women’s games(CQ 10). 

The differences in attendance and revenue may account for the discrepancy between the salaries for men’s and women’s basketball, with Cronin at $4.2M per year and head women’s basketball coach Cori Close making $600,000 per year. However, the wage gap between the coaches for men’s and women’s sports exists in sports other than basketball. The only sport, out of the six sports where the men’s and women’s teams were coached by different individuals, in which the women’s coach made more than the men’s coach over the last 5 years was volleyball. 

### Can UCLA avoid massive contract buyouts in the future?

From 2015 to 2019, the third and fourth highest average salaries were paid to coaches that no longer work for UCLA as part of a contract buyout for former men’s basketball and football coaches. Contract buyouts are compensation promised to coaches in the case of termination before the end of the contract(CQ 11). The buyouts written into contracts are worth millions of dollars, such as Steve Alford’s $3.6M (CQ 12)for men’s basketball and Jim Mora’s $12M buyout for football (CQ 13).

Despite the risk of large payouts, buyouts are an important part of athletics contracts because coaches want insurance in case they lose public favor(CQ 14), Flintoft said.

“Avoiding buyouts is definitely tough because if you want to attract a good coach, you have to include a buyout in there in case things do go awry,” Flintoft said (CQ 15).

UCLA is not the only university budgeting large sums of money towards athletic departments and coaching salaries. Within the PAC-12, the annual Head Football coach salary from 2015 to 2020 averaged almost $3 million(CQ 16), and all schools have exceeded an annual salary over 1.5 million dollars in the same period.
 The chart above shows the base scheduled pay for the head football coaching position based on the contract each coach signed at the beginning of his first season. However, this number does not include the additional monetary bonuses coaches can receive from broadcasting revenue, team records, accomplishments and appearances. 


 
### Conclusion
In light of UCLA Football’s 8-4 finish and qualification for a bowl game last season, Flintoft said Kelly’s 4.7M per year contract may be on the higher end, but still was within normal compared to who UCLA competes with(CQ 17). 

Ultimately, the valuing coaches is part of the Athletic Director’s job and can help decide what level of compensation is fair(CQ 18), as part of contract negotiations to put their school and athletic program in the best position to succeed. 

Coaches are measured by a range of statistics including records, graduation rates, and playoff performance, but some aspects of coaching cannot be measured with a statistic. Musser said coaches are there to help athletes succeed, even outside of the sport.

 “A coach is there to guide you and to teach you and to help you succeed, not just on the court or on the playing field, or in the gym, but to help you go where you want to whether it's Pro or whether it's to make a greater influence, as you proceed on with life.” Musser said(CQ 19).
