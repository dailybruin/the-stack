There is presently a lot of fear and some misinformation within the UCLA community due to the COVID-19 outbreak. With uncertainty about how things will pan out, data can help put some of those fears into perspective.  


# Fatality Rate

- A commonly misquoted number for the fatality rate is about 2%. This latest figure by WHO, in fact, much higher at 3.4% and is likely to grow, as there might be more fatalities among the currently [active cases](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6). The common way of computing fatality rate (as the ratio of number of deaths to the total number of cases) can be misleading as there are significantly many active cases the outcome of which are unkown.

So, for example, on _date_ there were _cases_ active cases, and _fatalities_ number of fatalities, making the fatality rate _rate_. However, 7 days later, once the outcome of the cases was better know, this number trickled up to _fatalities_ with _fatality rate_ fatality rate.

An important note is also that during the SARS outbreak, the WHO [initially reported](https://www.who.int/csr/sars/archive/2003_04_14/en/) a fatality rate of 4%, but which eventually rose to 9.6%.

Based on this [study](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/162/5/479/82647) on computing fatality ratio during an outbreak, we estimate the rate based on the number of cases

- It is true that younger people have a far lower fatality risk. The fatality rate for people under 40 is about 0.2% which is twice the death rate of the flu, but still relatively non-threatening. This [number goes up]((https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/)) dramatically once you hit 40 though (and reaches about 15% post 80).
So this means our professors are more of a concern than us.

But as someone mentioned in some comments, we don't want to become carriers and take the disease back home to our loved ones.

// Commuter demographic, risk taking disease home

Also many people will travel home during spring break.

# Exponentiation

Human intuition of exponents is quite poor and the reason for [the rice and chessboard legend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byk3pA1GPgU). 

But basically, Italy and South Korea however impossible they may seem, are realistic scenarios within a couple of weeks.

# Risk to Housing

// Figure about the number of people living in university housing (with roommates)

Also if we have an outbreak, isolation in the dorms or people with multiple roommates is going to be difficult. 

Maybe don't buy a ticket to Coachella, you know? (that just seems unsanitary without the virus)

- Also don't be racist seems like a good advice in general but please don't be racist. The coronavirus doesn't discriminate based on race, so don't be more of a jackass than the corona virus. Be better than corona y'all, I believe in you :) 

# Cost with UC Ship


# Other Possible Impacts
- **Economic Downturn**: the ability of some of the graduating folks to find jobs as there seems to be a recession coming. 
- **Travel**: many of the international students from severely impacted countries will probably not be able to go home for a long time (and also have to deal with the fact that their family is at risk)
- **Graduation**: many parents (especially of international kids) will not be able to come for graduation, in fact, there might not be a graduation ceremony at all this year if things get particularly bad. It's

# Never Hurts to Repeat CDC Guidelines

# Measures Taken by Other Universities?

- It can relapse.

TLDR: You're not going to die, but there are still reasons to be concerned.
